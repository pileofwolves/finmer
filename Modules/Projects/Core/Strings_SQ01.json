				"In his unconscious state, the big lizard is helpless to stop you. You spread your jaws wide and cram his head in your maw, hungrily swallowing your prey whole. Your tongue sloppily slurps over every scale and bit of skin it can possibly find, giving it a good coating of {player.species}-drool while also savoring the food's flavor. With each gulp, more of the lizard disappears into your digestive system, your belly growing to contain your catch. Before long, nothing is left but a limply hanging tail, which doesn't last long either - it gets sucked up like a noodle to join its owner inside a {player.species}."

Only loud gurgles and glorps come from the busy stomach as it works its newest prize into nutritious sludge - all that the local alchemist has been reduced to. But it'll be a while longer until it's done digesting its meal, and as you consider this, a wave of lethargy washes over you. You sit down behind the desk and fall asleep, listening to the organic chorus as if it were some kind of lullaby."

				"The heat and pressure of the soft flesh constantly pressing in on you is unbearable, and you feel your {player.fur} falling off in places, exposing the soft flesh underneath to the merciless digestive acid. To add insult to injury, your predator lets out a loud belch, robbing you of whatever air you had left. Folds of stomach walls squeeze at you, eager to knead you into slop. Your muscles are drained of their strength, if not already being directly attacked by caustic juices, leaving you unable to further protest to the onslaught of physical digestion. Luckily for you, however, the lack of fresh oxygen quickly causes you to black out.\\n\\nOutside, the engorged lizard sits down by a crackling fireplace, a good book in his hand as he contentedly lets his body process the bulk of {player.species}-meat. Even as the bulge falls still, the alchemist wonders where to get his missing ingredient from. Quietly, however, he hopes that the next adventurer to blunder into his stomach will be as delicious and as good a squirmer as you were."

				"After having spent the vast majority of the next day snoring and sleeping off his meal, the grizzled reptile rises from the comfort of a simple bed. He wraps his arms around his greatly swollen gut and hefts it up slightly, earning several loud groans and gurgles as its contents slosh around. Clearly, that dumb {player.species} in there is goop by now, but by no means gone just yet. The establishment might just have to remain closed for one more day as the shopkeep finishes digesting his prey.\\n\\nJar'la had had the foresight to regurgitate some of his prey's bones before they were damaged too much or fully dissolved outright. Now, your skull, bleached clean by strong acids and perhaps slightly less thick than usual, rests neatly on a bookshelf, posing as a somewhat appropriate ornament for this place, while liquified meat is being pumped through the lizard's bowels, to be drained and compacted into waste and released later. Nobody would miss some random, nameless adventurer - not even the alchemist himself, who is content to be kept company by his stomach's chorus of digestion, and his ever-growing collection of trophies."

				"Jar'la's quarterstaff slams hard into your stomach. There is a surprising force behind the seemingly trivial weapon, as if you were struck with hammer, and you cry out in pain. He wastes no time on this opportunity, seeing that you are left unable to defend yourself. The lizard wraps his arms around you tightly and opens his looming maw. Hot, sour-smelling breath wafts against your face as your face is pushed forward, your nose breaking a few strands of drool as you make contact with the soft, squishy tongue in front of you. You see the muscles at the back of the reptile's maw wiggle in anticipation for a split second before a powerful swallow sends your head down the fleshy abyss. At this point, Jar'la has you right where he wants you, and nothing in your power could possibly stop him from sending you down to a rather acidic grave. Slowly but steadily, each gulp pulls more of your body in. You wince as your head pokes into a slightly roomier space - the stomach, of course. The stench of acid and meat is strong here, and the thought strikes you that these softly pulsating walls around you will grind you down into mush, like all other food that has ever passed here. With a few more swallows and a loving last lick on your feet, the predatory shopkeep finishes you off, watching his gut expand to accommodate the overload of fresh, squirming meat. \"Not so talkative now, are you, meat?\" he taunts, rubbing your form in his oversized belly while he disappears in the back of the shop, seeking to digest his meal in private."

It could be considered a funny twist how you did unto him exactly what he was about to do unto you, but now it matters little. Thick, long logs of {player.species}-shit make their way into the outside world, dropping onto the mahogany planks with a wet plop. After a minute of producing an impressive pile of waste, you decide it is enough, and finish up. There will be a lot more work for your bowels to go around for the next day or two. With that in mind, you grin, glancing at your handiwork, before returning to the front room."
