Entirely unfazed, Iso steps forward and places two paws on the massive beast's snout, receiving a sloppy lick for her trouble. The difference in size is stunning; that tongue could have curled around her, and yet the beast shows remarkable restraint. \"We won't be long, Chip. Go sleep,\" she whispers.

The night is a considerable boon in this matter, making it much easier for the two of you to hide - not least of which Iso with her pitch-black fur. Along the way, the mayor had made a snide throwaway remark about the concept of having poles with lanterns on them lining the streets. Apparently she'd seen them once in a nearby city, and while useful, the maintenance burden is hefty indeed. In fact, Iso is surprisingly casual and chatty for someone who had their head pulled out of a slimy gullet an evening or two ago and is now breaking into their own home."

				"Her demeanor falters, however, when you turn another corner and stop in front of a single-story house that, for all intents and purposes, does not appear to be any different whatsoever from the ones surrounding it. And perhaps that is the point - from what you have gathered, Iso does not strike you as the kind of person to flaunt her status and wealth unnecessarily.\\n\\n\"My place isn't big, so we should be in and out quickly enough,\" she says. Anxiously glancing over her shoulder to make sure there are no undesired tag-alongs, the pantheress steps up to the front door, and inserts a key... only to find that the unremarkable, sturdy wooden door drifts open with a tired moan, its lock already undone - or, more accurately, destroyed."

				"\"Ah, shit,\" the mayor grunts simply, a great many thoughts running through her head, and yours - though the immediate conclusion to be drawn here is obvious. She does not speak further, pocketing the unused key again and pushing the ajar door open, stepping into her home. Quickly, you follow."

				"The return trip is silent and uneventful. Retracing your steps through town and avoiding attention exactly as you had done on the way in, you walk back to Rux's - this time in comfortable silence. After her lapse in self-control, she has not been in the particular mood for conversation. Still, there is nothing that really needs to be said right now, and so, by the time you reach the inconspicuous log cabin in the middle of absolute nowhere, a glimmer of dawn creeps through the trees, bathing the forest in a strangely reassuring glow. You breathe a sigh of relief then. It's funny, in a sense, how much the Adept's home has started to feel like a safe haven in such a short time."

				"Where Iso had previously been looking for her friend's pet dire wolf, she now merely marches ahead toward the front door, not bothering to check if Chip is nearby. Not that it matters either way; it seems the guardian is not around. So sunk into thought she is, in fact, that when she pushes the front door open and steps through, the pantheress almost forgets there is, in fact, someone else walking behind her. She backs up just in time to prevent the door from crashing into your face, muttering a quick apology, before hurrying on inside."

The fireplace is still lit, and the red panda himself sits at the dining table, raising a teacup in greeting. \"Welcome back,\" he states simply, his unoccupied paw gesturing brusquely to the other two teacups sitting on the table, wisps of steam billowing from the liquid inside."

After a few moments, you join the two - a chance to rest your legs after a straining walk through the woods is a welcome change, after all. The old hermit, perhaps sensing the change in his friend's demeanour, decides to probe for details, though still ever in his own grandfatherly, almost cryptic manner. \"Did you find what you were looking for?\" he asks. A simple question, but a well-phrased one, you decide - one that leaves many a door open for the feline to respond to."

She places the photo on the table, and turns it to the Adept. Rux studies the printed memory, humming solemnly. \"I see,\" is all the pantheress receives in response. She downs the contents of her teacup all in one go, gently sets it back down, and rises again. \"Thank you, Rux,\" she says, turning to nod to you as well, before she walks towards the door of the bedroom she had been using, and disappears inside."

For a brief moment, despite the fact that you are welcome in this safe haven, you feel a little out of place, though you soon rationalize that Iso simply desires a little bit of space. Finally, the red panda sets down his cup, picks up the picture frame, and walks over to a shelf on the wall. There, between books and memorabilia, he sets it down. With an approving hum, he sticks his paws in the sides of his robes and glances at you."
