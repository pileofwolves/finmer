It takes you a brief moment to remember the fact that you got yourself sloshing about inside the stomach of a dire wolf - and by some miracle, you are still in one piece after having spent however many hours in here. As if on cue, the chamber caves inwards, wrapping you in a cocoon of throbbing meat, though you soon realize it is shunting you upwards."

				"Chip's guts - or perhaps his throat, it is difficult to tell the difference when you are soaked in drool as you are - convulse and shift, clearly propelling you somewhere. It is only when your head emerges into the predator's open maw, that you realize he is in fact retching quite loudly in an attempt to release you from your gurgling prison. The thick layer of slime coating you serves as excellent lubrication, if the speed by which you are being regurgitated is any indication. With surprising ease, you slide right across the canine's soft, undulating tongue, past his sharp fangs, into a grassy, drool-soaked patch on the ground. The temperature difference is almost painful - the fluid sticking to your {player.fur} quickly sapping heat, and you find yourself almost longing for the tight warmth of the dire wolf once more. The predator in question, meanwhile, gives you one more playful lick before he turns tail, teasingly waves his fluffy butt, and trots back off to his usual sleeping spot. You would've sworn you saw him winking."

The Adept's cabin is just off to the side, and you can head south to leave the clearing."

You've barely had time to shut the door behind you, in some attempt to not let Rux's attempts at heating his home go to waste, before the monstrosity known as Chip is all over you. In a surprisingly puppy-like behavior, he lowers his head in between stretched front legs, raising his rump up in the air while his tail wags in a decidedly un-wolf-like manner."

Chip swallows once, a wet gllllllrrrrk reverberating through your arms, as the whole dish, leather bowl and all, is dislodged from your care and vanishes wholesale into the creature's gullet. The suction is so strong that you even feel your paws being dragged along for a brief moment, until the wolf opens his maw once more with a happy sigh, food bowl nowhere in sight. Now you understand the peculiar choice of platter. As the subtle throat bulge vanishes into his chest, you cannot help but wonder how many unwanted guests this oversized guard dog has 'removed' from the premises over the years."

				"On the outside of your digestive hell, Chip lazily smacks his lips. Whether he realizes the gravity of swallowing another person whole or not, you are fast becoming indistinguishable from the chunky sludge that has been sloshing about in that gut alongside yourself. The wolf casually rolls over on his back, exposing his fluffy belly to nobody in particular. The soft, light-silvery fur on his gut shifts and distorts as the meat within kicks its last kicks. With a meal of this size, the dire wolf would be sated for a few days at least - his master would figure out he'd snacked on some silly adventurer again, but there was little either of them could do about it at this point. With a noxious belch, Chip's stomach compacts tightly, crushing the now-nameless meal into a meaty slurry, slowly draining deeper into the wolf's guts for further processing over the course of many hours. Just another snack."

You just hope the big pup will be gentle as you continue to pet him."

Slowly, making sure to both the predator and yourself that there would be no undesirable surprises, you press your paws into his belly, and you find yourself somewhat surprised at just how soft and doughy that gut is. On the outside, he certainly does not look the part, but the wolf has a healthy layer of pudge for tougher times. Either that, or his diet of random adventurers is somewhat more prevalent than you might have initially assumed. Chip, for his part, rumbles approvingly. One of his front paws moves to hook around your middle, gently pulling you in closer, but by no means forcefully."

You continue massaging the big pup for some time, until a slurp on your head catches you off guard. It seems the feral is happy to bask in your attention quite a bit, and the best way for him to show as much is by soaking your head in goopy, reeking drool, of course. No matter, you can wash it off later, so with newfound appreciation, you continue, paws roaming around that coarse belly fur, occasionally stopping to gently knead..."

At full height, you can barely reach his nose with the tips of your fingers, and even then, only when he leans down a little. Up close, it becomes clear just how massive this predator truly is - and to what lengths Rux must have gone to tame him in such a manner. The wolf takes a step towards you, but while you expect him to brush against you in some manner like an affectionate cat might, he instead slams a front paw into your chest, forcing you down to the damp forest floor, leaving you breathless in the process. Then the rest of the wolf follows suit: Chip simply bellyflops right on top of you, burying you in a sea of thick, damp fur. The very same belly that you had been massaging earlier is now pinning you down, leaving you immobilized entirely and struggling to breathe, submerged under fluff and pudge as you are."

Going by the sounds alone, you might think it is hard at work on something substantial. Fluids slosh around inside as the organs work and the wolf himself shifts. You did want to be closer to that belly, after all. With a happy sigh, amplified through your physical contact, the wolf finally relents before the lack of breathable air becomes a real problem. Chip rises to all fours again, with you directly below him, and as you rub your eyes and the cold forest air rushes over you again, you find yourself almost longing for that warm, furry blanket. But when you open your eyes once more, expecting to see a sheepish, satisfied wolf, you instead see a pair of wide open jaws, dribbling drool, rushing right for you."

The slick throat muscles flex and ripple, a loud, wet swallow shunting you forwards into the slimy tube. Even with the wolf's size, the gullet is skin-tight still. While the wolf's tongue does an excellent job at giving your {player.fur} a goopy, warm drool coating, you're forced to hold your breath as you slide down into the feral's depths, towards that impatiently gurgling stomach you had been admiring so much."
