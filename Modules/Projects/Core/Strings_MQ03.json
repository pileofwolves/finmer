				"Perhaps more accustomed to fighting dirty in the black of night, the husky gets the better of you. A well-timed jab staggers you; more than enough time for the fluffy dog to spread her jaws unnaturally wide and push the entirety of your head straight in the back of her maw. It seems this predator is quite excited to scarf you down. If Randall was drooling a lot at the sight of his beloved prey, then this one's maw is positively flooding with hot, sticky, foul saliva. There is way too much to just cover your face and shoulders, and so it ends up leaking down and covering your chest before Mia even gets around to swallowing that much. The tight, slimy tube pressing in around your face convulses rapidly, forcing you down with one greedy swallow after another.\\n\\nWhile you have no real measure of time with half your body sunk into digestive pit, you are fairly certain the husky is devouring you in record time. At the apex of the skin-tight journey lies the sour, bubbling gut that will strip the flesh from your bones in the next several hours. Before you even realize the stomach sphincter has finished spitting out your toes and tail, the meaty cavern collapses around you, eager to grind you down into chunky stew.\\n\\n\"Urrrp, that's a better place for you,\" the husky teases as you settle, paws roaming around your form to rub acid and slime into your {player.fur}. \"Now digest for me, meat.\""

				"The pantheress considers your question for a brief moment, eyes wandering to the incense offering on the altar. \"Well...\" She turns to you again, as if to answer, before loud knocks on the door startles all three of you. The door opens once more, the soft light of the lanterns scattered around the room illuminating a wolf's face. He pulls down his hood, revealing a short crimson mane running down a black-furred head. Dark, plain clothes drip rainwater on the pristine chalky flagstones. Iso's breath catches in her throat and Willow appears even more confused, as Randall offers a smile.\\n\\nUnlike the last time you met, he does not sport a horrifyingly large belly bulge - though knowing full well what he is capable of, keeping some distance is not unreasonable. \"There you are, my love,\" he says, a deceptively calm, rumbling voice laced with venom as he steps inside, not bothering to close the door behind him."

He appears almost offended at the response, though his muzzle soon returns to an impassive grimace.\\n\\n\"You sure made me work for it, but I finally found you after all this time.\" Randall growls. \"If I'd known you'd just show up, I wouldn't even have had to claim the Red Maw for myself.\" He grunts casually, almost like a chuckle, eyes flicking to you, then Willow, then back to Iso. \"Dragging in all these witless preythings-\"\\n\\n\"Damn it, Randall,\" she interrupts him with a growl of her own, her long, slender tail flicking about behind her. \"You're the one going around killing people, not me,\" Iso demands, raising her voice. \"You are the only one responsible for the shitshow that is your love life!\""

You can't even let me have that.\" He must have assumed their failure to report back in as evidence enough. Randall finds himself in the difficult position of being forced to choose between prey, and quickly at that. Ultimately, he focuses on the object of his desire, a smooth grin reappearing on his lips. \"But now, my love, enough chat. You are here, and you are not leaving my side ever again,\" he declares.\\n\\nWith that, he bounds over to the pantheress, lips curling into a snarl and eyes glimmering with little more than primal hunger. Drool dribbles from his maw as he attempts to wrap his arms around her. Willow squeaks and backs away. Iso reacts quickly, using her slender frame to her advantage to duck below his arms and recklessly kick him in his stomach, staggering the wolf and sending him backwards, right towards you."

The crazed, hateful hunger in his eyes speaks volumes of his temptation to eat you where you stand, though he tears his gaze away from you, to his preferred prey. Iso, meanwhile, did not waste the opportunity, her possessive stalker briefly occupied in a scuffle with yourself.\\n\\n\"Willow, we need to move,\" she manages to say, trying to usher Willow out of the room. \"{player.name}, it's me he's after!\" she adds, the lapine priestess behind her more or less mortified at the evening's proceedings.

Why did you leave me? Why was I not good enough?\" His meaty tongue lashes out from behind his black lips and drags across her face, leaving a thin coating of saliva squarely between her eyes.\\n\\n\"Go to hell, dogbreath,\" she hisses, grimacing and barely suppressing a cough. The wolf is by far the strongest of the two, and the mayor, knowing this, stopped bothering to struggle.\\n\\nPleased with this development, Randall grins. \"There'll be a lot more of that dogbreath for you to enjoy now that we can reunite,\" he taunts, before parting his lips and clamping his jaws around Iso's head."

You were just in time, too; though the feline's face is utterly soaked in reeking wolf slobber, she pulls free quite easily - a few seconds longer and it would have been near-impossible to overcome the experienced predator's powerful throat.\\n\\nRandall tumbles backwards, crashing right on top of the priestess. As if on reflex, Willow locks her arms around the beefy canine in an attempt to hold him down. In this moment, you rush over to the heaving mayor and help her up. Just off to your side, the unwelcome guest struggles violently against his lapine captor. \"Fucking whore! Unhand me, or you're wolf fat!\" he shouts, eyes ablaze. This had not gone the way he had desired, and he did not usually settle for anything less than his own desires. \"Go, you two!\" Willow yells. \"Go now!\""

The cold quickly overpowers the gentle warmth in the room, and several candles are extinguished.\\n\\nYou dash through, shutting it behind you to add a precious second of delay, but not before the lupine predator makes his displeasure known. \"ISO!\" he screams, almost having freed himself from the flailing healer, his voice echoing into the rainy night.

Without evidence to the contrary, it seems perhaps the mayor got away.\\n\\nThat is when you notice that Randall has gained some weight, so to speak. His jacket is held open by a huge dome of black fur, sagging down well over his belt. The bulge shifts rather violently - obviously someone is kicking about in there, alive but not for much longer. From your vantage point, you cannot quite make out details, though by the looks of it, the wolf's meal is thrashing up a storm. It isn't until he slaps his gut as if to discipline it, that it gurgles so loudly even you can hear it.
