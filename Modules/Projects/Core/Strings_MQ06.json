Having delayed your advance for a precious few seconds, Randall seems ready to initiate his ritual after all. He stands calmly in the middle of the circle on the ground, turned halfway away from the commotion as if he is not even aware there is a fight for life and death going on.

The shard absorbs the crimson stain, a tiny wisp of red smoke dissipating from the surface.\\n\\nThe deep, brilliant amber changes color, darkening like old, dried blood, before settling on a deep blue. Its misty hues swirl under the surface like a turbulent ocean. The wolf raises his paw, clutching the crystal tightly as it pulses with a gentle glow.\\n\\nBeside you, Rux starts, his eyes widening with horror. Whatever he sees that you do not, it effortlessly peels away the professional, grandfatherly attitude the red panda has always worn. \"NO, DON'T!\" he shouts in uncharacteristic panic, reaching out with one paw, hopelessly far away."

With sudden violence, Randall thrusts his arm forward, stabbing empty air with the charged crystal. His arm sails through nothing, until the wolf meets resistance, as if having struck an invisible wall. The discolored amber shard dissolves into dust, carried away by the wind. A rush of cold air washes over you, a shockwave that ruffles fur and disturbs dead leaves on the worn stones.\\n\\nThen, a network of thin, pale blue cracks forms in the open air. They snake away in all directions, like a window had been struck with a hammer and is barely holding itself together. The mystical disturbance is no bigger than a snowball, suspended two meters above the ground, before it explodes.

				"Dim {!sun}light filters through the canopy of the woods as the three of you stride through the untamed growth. The Adept weaves between the trees as if he were marching on a cobblestone street. Whether he sees something more than you do, or whether he has walked this road so many times it's burned into his memory, you cannot say. Luckily, all you need to do is keep up, and that is easy enough. Iso makes few attempts at bringing up smalltalk topics. None of them last longer than a few words - and it's not just because there is a tension hanging in the air. There is a long road ahead, literally and figuratively, and beyond another review of the plan you had hastily put together, all there is to do is to walk. So instead, in this moment you find yourself simply taking pleasure in the beauty of nature, untouched by civilization. Another step, one foot in front of the other..."

				"There is not always much to say. Idle chatter had ground to a halt by the time you approach the halfway point of your multi-hour journey. A somewhat tense silence takes hold instead. Both of your companions had each pointed out small shortcuts here and there to keep off the main roads and cut off bits and pieces of travel time. Still, the abbey is quite a distance from the Adept's home, and everyone is understandably apprehensive about the upcoming confrontation. Despite having been able to come up with a somewhat sensible plan, owing to the intelligence you managed to collect, all this is still a long shot. That is, if the antagonistic wolf even succeeds in his plan, considering Rux did mention there are no other formally trained Adepts in the Finmer region."

				"\"{player.name},\" Iso says, idly rubbing at her cheek with one paw. \"About, er, them... do you think we should try to bring in any of them alive, if we can? I've already skirted some laws, so I'm debating whether it'd be better to keep this matter, you know, between us. What do you think?\""

				"The pantheress nods, considering your response. She says nothing more. Tense silence takes the stage once more, your conversation topics having run dry. Neither of your companions seem particularly willing to contribute smalltalk of their own, so the only thing left to do is to walk. One foot in front of the other, just as before. Maybe the idea of riding along on a chatty chameleon merchant's rickety carriage is not such a curse after all."
