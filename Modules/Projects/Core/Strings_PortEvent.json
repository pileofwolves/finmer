				"When a change in the environment rouses you from your comfortable nap, you take several moments to understand where you are, what's happening to you, and what these wet, slimy sheets of rubber clinging to entire body are. Right, Holly must be spitting you up - seems you had slept through the night. Though your sense of gravity is thoroughly distorted by the powerful flesh groping your form from all sides, you feel like you're heading in the wrong direction, though. This theory is confirmed when you feel your toes slipping through a muscular sphincter that immediately seals shut behind you, and your travels through these guts stop."

				"Instead, the new chamber you find yourself in clamps down on your body and begins churning - slowly at first, steadily picking up momentum and force. The thick, veiny walls of this new stomach are nowhere near as plush and comfortable as the ones you had been surrounded with earlier. No, these are the real deal, meant for mechanically grinding down food. The sound of air rushing in and out of your host's lungs in the form of obnoxiously loud snores all but confirms the obvious: you had been drawn into the second stomach and curl up in this somewhat roomier organ, completely trapped and at the mercy of a predator who is fast asleep. You had best think of something fast."

				"Soon enough, you lose consciousness in the gurgling, churning pit. If you might have considered the first stomach an unpleasant environment to sleep in, the second stomach is easily doing away with your expectations. It cares not for your physical integrity, in fact seeking the opposite. With the taur's sheer size, her abdomen is packing a substantial volume of muscle and flesh, all of which is now in full drive with the express purpose of crushing, grinding and melting you down into nutritious slurry. Luckily, you at least will not be awake for the more harrowing parts of the journey.\\n\\nHolly sighs contentedly in her sleep, not quite realizing the source of her newfound fullness, as the core of her digestive system takes full advantage of your rather compromising position. As your form falls still, digestion picks up rapidly, the slab of {player.species}-meat soon disintegrating into a messy stew, primed for the next leg of the journey through the taur's bowels. Unfortunately for you, your temporary stay had been upgraded into a permanent one.\\n\\nYour consolation prize: at least you'd keep your captor fed for a little while."

				"The first thing the taur notices when she rouses from her comfortable rest is the softened mass weighing down her lower stomach. It takes her several moments to understand where the massive bulk of food is coming from, before grim realization dawns on the tigress' muzzle. She had sworn to never try something like this again - not after the last incident - but that cute {player.species} had kept incessantly asking for it, and she caved to the demand. What lunacy, to send someone down into a digestive tract, with the promise to keep them safe overnight.\\n\\nBut there is little to be done about that now - the only reality left for Holly is to dispose of the waste product that follows. With a grunt or two, she rises from her sleeping quarters, guilt rising as partially digested gut slop noisily splashes about within her lower stomach. Padding over to the toilet area, the predator takes some solace in the fact that South Finmer has a rudimentary sewage system - though she would certainly be testing its limits. With surprising ease, the tigress hikes her tail and begins expelling logs of fresh feces. What once used to be a person is now packed together into worthless tiger shit, dropping down into the pit below her rump. Spending a full minute squeezing out one chunk of waste after the other - you were a sizeable meal after all - she waits for her anus to squeeze shut once more.\\n\\nIf the weight on her guts is any indication, she'd be making more trips like that. Almost fearfully, she glances over to the mess she made, committed to feeling ashamed and guilty for the next week or so, before depositing it in the tunnel below. Maybe it would be best to not open up shop today."

As you move to accept the invitation, she strides past you, plump belly brushing against you. You could have sworn you just heard that furry tank grumble at you, but Holly seems to not notice, or care. Seeing a seated tiger-taur behind the bar is one thing; up close and personal it is always impressive to see just how much bulk there is to the average taur. \"Why don't you pop on over to the back room, and undress, dearie? There's a box in the corner you can put your things in. Would hate to get them wet.\" With quick, wide paces that would leave any athletic anthro jealous, the orange-furred tigress walks over to the restaurant's front door and flips the 'open' sign in front of the glass."

Everything looks to be well-organized and clean - you recall seeing food preparation stations that have been significantly less impressive. But that is not why you are here. Pressing a paw against the thin wooden door separating the dining room from a private back room, you step inside, finding yourself in a quiet, dimly lit space. Bulky shelves line the walls of the room, stuffed with all manner of burlap sacks and nondescript packages.\\n\\nA large open crate sits in the corner, drawing by far the most attention owing to the brightly colored fresh produce sitting inside. The container is almost empty - seems like Holly doesn't want to keep excessive stock considering the downturn in local activity, and you decide that is probably a good decision for both her financials and the health of would-be guests. The rest of the room, especially in the center, is left entirely open, plain wooden boards covering the floor and a lantern hanging overhead. You realize this is probably intentional - a taur needs more space to move around, after all."

Now utterly nude, a slight chill seeps through your {player.fur}. You reconsider the sheer lunacy of what it is you are about to do. As warm and welcoming as the tiger-taur appears to be, her insides may not share such a disposition. Very few people can say they have been swallowed, and lived to tell others of their experience, and yet for some inexplicable reason you are deciding to go along with a dive into a digestive tract. You just have to keep reminding yourself shelter is important - though that nagging thought, as to whether or not you are truly entering shelter, persists. A door on the opposite wall catches your eye then, slightly ajar, permitting you a peek inside. All you can see from this angle is a huge bed; understandably, it is more practical for most business owners to sleep where they work."

What you now know to be a practiced predator looks you over, and you cannot help but feel like a cornered prey animal, with the way her generous form blocks the only exit. Perhaps realizing this, Holly enters the store room fully, gently closing the door behind her. For a door that does not possess a locking mechanism at all, she takes significantly more time than one might expect to make sure the divider is shut.\\n\\nYou are left in awkward silence, stealing glances at her rump and striped belly. Taurs almost never wear clothes from their anthro half down, considering the sheer impracticality of donning and doffing it, not to mention the inherent difficulty in obtaining appropriately-sized garments in the first place. Your host for the night is no exception, granting you plenty of time to stare at her rounded midsection, swaying ever so slightly with her movements. You'd be in there soon. Or, no, wait, not there - that was the dangerous stomach.\\n\\n\"Enjoying the view, sweetie?\" Holly dryly remarks, turning to regard you fully. \"A little nervous, I see?

It's just a wet slide, and then you'll have a private room all to yourself. I'll let you back out in the morning. You might even enjoy it, dear, though I should warn you it might smell a little.\" Her long, slender tail sways behind her, and you cannot help but notice all the signs of a carnivore that is seconds away from claiming its dinner. Despite her seemingly benign intentions, her limbs tense slightly as if preparing to pounce. The anthro belly that you are brushing against gurgles ominously - a tank that demands filling - and you could have sworn she is licking drool from her lips. A good sign, you tell yourself; the better lubricated your trip would be, the safer it would be for both of you. Snapping you out of your instinctual reverie, the tiger-taur presses her muzzle into your forehead, permitting herself a little lick and taste.\\n\\n\"Ready?\" she asks, though she then foregoes actually waiting for an answer, as if fearful you might change your mind. Her jaws part widely before you, a meaty, drool-soaked cavern lined with sharp fangs. Fetid breath overwhelms your olfactory senses, and a wide, slimy tongue rolls out of that maw like a carpet inviting you home. You don't even realize you were being drawn inside until your face presses into that undulating appendage with a disgusting squelch."

Unaware of your newfound dislike of her maw, or perhaps uncaring of it, Holly begins swallowing. Within a split second, the slimy muscle underneath your chin compresses your face into the roof of the mouth, a veritable torrent of slobber soaking your {player.fur}. What little light leaks into the vile cavern between sharp fangs is just enough to show the throbbing throat at the back of your predator's maw, the entrance to the tube beyond eagerly rippling, as if you were already touching it. The tigress is more than happy to help you close the distance, and with a convulsing squeeze of the tongue, your nose presses into the waiting gullet. It accepts you with a disgusting squelch as you breach a myriad of saliva strands. The maw caves in, the ridged roof collapsing onto you, as your head is forced through the fleshy entrance wholesale, into the esophagus."

The noise level, in a sense, leaves something to be desired, although with your ears flattened against throbbing muscles, you could perhaps not be considered the most impartial judge.\\n\\nEvery sound that Holly's innards makes - every ominous gurgle, every squirt and slosh of fluid, every thundering thump of her heart - is amplified by your sheer proximity, leaving absolutely no question to the idea that you are, indeed, entering someone's very core. Before long, your feet have left the ground, the tigress seemingly content to just lift you up entirely as she devours your body. At around the same time, your snout touches a tightly sealed sphincter.\\n\\nAs if on reflex, the ring of muscle parts for you with surprising ease, permitting you to pass through, but not without a nasty, wet squelch or two.

Seemingly sensing your distress, the organ expands further out the harder you squeeze into it, which is a good thing considering just how much {player.species} is being deposited into this cramped space. Within mere moments, or perhaps it is several minutes, your paws and tail join you inside this slippery cavern, the entrance sealing shut behind you with a wet kiss.\\n\\nAll you know, feel, hear and smell is soft, pliant flesh, cradling your body.
