You can no longer hear him now, though the occasional twitch is enough to tell you he still lives, if barely. Of course, your stomach will take care of that problem soon enough; a loud gurgle and a violent crunch of your bowels signal the start of biological processes proper. The meat that was once named Randall can do nothing but submit to the first stages of mechanical digestion. For the supposed bad guy, he went down pretty smoothly."

As your struggles inevitably slow down, Randall gives his oversized furry gut a slap, the doughy dome jiggling as fluid splashes around. \"Come on, already? They usually last longer,\" he taunts. \"Squirm some more for me, will ya?\"\\n\\nBut alas, your weakened and well-tenderized body is easily pickings for the onslaught of the digestive organ. Rippling walls knead and chew away at you, splashing slime everywhere and regularly renewing the layers of gooey acid as it slowly but surely works on you. With no more air left to breathe and warm flesh closing in on all sides, you finally give out. Just another worthless lump of meat for the large wolf to process overnight."

Inside the predator's stomach remains only a meaty slurry, enough to make Randall's stomach swell out a fair bit, though nowhere near as much as the bulge you made last night. Most of that bulk has, indeed, either been added as a nice extra layer of pudge on the wolf's belly or hips, though an equally large part has been processed fully by the predator's digestive system.\\n\\nAfter a minute, Randall finishes emptying bowels, having piled your remains into a pretty impressive mound of wolf shit. The process is certainly not finished, though, and the lupine's stomach gurgles loudly as it resumes digesting its large meal. For now, however, the gang boss is satisfied and carelessly walks away. Nobody will find your remains, and now the wolf can resume his hunt uninterrupted. A smug grin spreads on his muzzle, already thinking about who to swallow next."

Unlike Randall, however, you don't stop there. Lunging forward, you engulf the canine's head inside your own before he has a chance to mount a proper resistance. A wet glllllrrrrk follows, your throat pulling itself vacuum as Randall begins his one-way journey down into your digestive tract. At this point, you have him in a vice grip - no outside interference would suffice; it is only with your permission that the wolf moves.\\n\\nAnd so you continue swallowing, quickly stripping the fallen predator of his jacket and pants so that your meaty tongue can explore his thick ebony fur. Your meal has a rich, earthy flavor, perhaps as you might expect from a lupine fur coat - wherever you finished sampling the meat, the fur is matted down with a thick layer of saliva before it slides down the slick abyss of your gullet. You recognize the moment your digestive system dunks Randall into a slimy acid pit when you hear a yell reverberate through your guts and his dangling legs kick awkwardly. No matter; you will have him where he belongs quite soon.\\n\\nA moment longer, and your head tilts skyward, the unfortunate wolf on your lips failing utterly in his fight against gravity. Another token swallow seals the lupine inside, now surrounded on all sides by hot, pulsating flesh as your well-lubricated muscles deposit him neatly as a ball of meat."

Your muzzle breaks several sticky strands of saliva as you touch, and start sliding across the predator's meaty tongue. With several loud, powerful swallows, the muscle around you expertly grips your face and squeezes, forcing you into the wolf's digestive tract. Randall greedily gulps down his latest catch, and before long your nose enters the opening into the predator's stomach.\\n\\nThe stench that hits you is unbearable; some mixture of an acid pit and processed meat. The digestive sack has been exceptionally busy even before your arrival; acidic slime trickles and seeps from between every fold of flesh. Thick goop coats the walls. Most of the open space in the stomach is occupied with a chunky, furry mess, no doubt the remains of the previous soul to venture into the gang boss's jaws. The horrible, greasy, grainy, slimy texture of the partially digested tiger you're being crammed up against also serves a nice reminder of what's about to happen to you, too. With each noisy swallow, more of your body is deposited into the warm, oppressively tight organ and you are forced to curl up into a {player.furry} ball of {player.species}-meat, displacing the digested sludge around you to make room.\\n\\nMore than a few bones snap around you as you claim space. Once Randall finishes devouring you, your feet join you inside the caustic furnace and the wolf on the outside licks his paws clean, giving his massive gut a few loving pats. The searing hot flesh quickly begins clenching and kneading away at you, eager to grind you down into the same meaty slush that surrounds you."
