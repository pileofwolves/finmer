Oh, right, he'd had double dinner, some weirdo took a dive while he was trying to sleep off his first meal.\\n\\nThe wolf looming over him steps back with a displeased scowl, shaking his head before a flicker of curiosity shines through. \"They squirm well, at least?\" he asks, to which Ethel shakes his head. \"I don't even remember who.

The canine is a tough nut to please, but it may admittedly also have to do with Ethel's pattern of loafing around lately. He can't help it - there is something so viscerally satisfying about turning squirming meat into something unspeakably messy and undignified. With new orders in mind - ones that he actually aims to follow, lest he finds the apex predator's gaze turn his way - he has a chance to discretely dispose of his digested prey; a chore he is looking forward to greatly.

				"He points sternly at the street, and that warm, cheeky glint that you had come to recognize from the merchant seems to have made way for annoyance.\\n\\n\"Out,\" he commands, and you are left with little choice but to sheepishly comply. Gently you rise, finding your muscles more than a little sore from the impromptu overnight massage, but in your desire to not keep the frustrated lizard waiting lest he makes a bigger problem out of this scene, you climb over a crate or two and land on the cobblestone street with your own two paws. The fresh, salty air tastes refreshing after having spent another hour, if not more, wedged under a stifling cloth that was never meant to be used as a blanket."

				"Shaking his head, Zosk fastens the tarp over the cart again, casting another glare over his shoulder in your general direction, before a spark of amusement flickers in these eyes as they return to his work of hiding any evidence you left behind. You take the time to take stock of your situation as well; it seems you had been deposited in the harbor area of South Finmer, if the familiar-looking docks, unoccupied merchant stalls and monotonous spruce buildings are any indication. Only a few hours have passed since daybreak, it seems, though nevertheless that is a considerable amount of time to spend sprawling on barrels and crates."

No need to get the town guard involved, yes?\" He sighs, shrugging, or perhaps shivering in the autumn chill, tying the tarp down with another knot."

Not like this though. Get some sleep in a real bed, {player.species}-friend. Better for the back, oho.\"\\n\\nWith that comment, the merchant casts a final glance at you as you put a little more distance in between yourself and the carriage, before he hops back onto the bench, and strangely enough, licks his paws. \"Time to go home!\" he declares to his mount, who could be said to have perked up from its perpetual dissociative state at those words. With his trademark clapping noise, the strange duo sets off again, departing for greener pastures - or perhaps simply better-heated ones."

Yes - you had discovered some critically important information during your unwelcome visit to the Maw; there will be two very interested parties awaiting your return.
