With the warm, slimy haze enveloping your butt and legs, your head's journey through the skin-tight esophagus comes to an end. The stomach below opens up for you, a large, distended chamber blasting fumes of bile and rotting, partially processed food right into your nostrils, and you fail to suppress a gag. This was the acidic grave of another {player.species} who came before you, and as you sink into the mire of chyme, you realize that this is exactly what you will be reduced to in a manner of hours. Clearly, fighting with a full stomach has not proven to be a disadvantage for the ravenous predator. Once the digestive organ finishes spitting out your feet and tail, you curl up into a ball, surrounded by a flood of warm, gooey mush.

As you fade away, a perhaps once promising candidate for the Club, Rech resigns himself to having to carry you around for the night, perhaps another. At least with a swollen stomach and fresh prey on his breath, he might be even more effective at scaring away the overly curious than usual. Though the {player.species} had tasted wonderfully, it really was a shame, he thought. The bouncer would've been interested to see where your path might have taken you. But, alas, he sighs as he gingerly removes one hand from his gut and extracts the tiny, tarnished metal disk from his pocket again, idly turning it over. If the coin decides you are food, who was he to argue?"

				"The impressively muscled crocodile reaches out with one arm, taking the tiny item you offered him. Briefly, he holds it up in the air and studies it, then gracefully slides it into his pocket. \"The coin, huh?\" he mutters, turning to you. An eyebrow is raised before he breaks the awkward silence with a chuckle and a shake of his head. For a moment, you feel perhaps a bit smaller under the crushing gaze of the bouncer."

				"Without warning, the huge reptile slams into you and pins you to the brick wall behind you, forcing the air from your lungs if only briefly. \"Oh, and I had such hopes for you when you came here, {player.species}. But if she says to eat you...\" he begins, parting his jaws and taking his time to show off the gaping, pulsating depths of flesh before his meaty tongue drags across your face. The throat widens as if anticipating your arrival, and you have a sinking feeling that there might just be a reason why Rech is the one responsible for keeping the peace in this establishment. \"...then so be it,\" he finishes, leaving you ample time to sample the hot, strong-smelling air wafting from the open cavern. \"The coin is reserved for those who are to be 'disposed' of, yeah? Well...\""

				"\"... you'll figure it out.\" And with that, Rech effortlessly fits his jaws around your head, permitting you a few more samples of hot, stale breath, and swallows. Heated air, thick with the scent of meat, is soon replaced with sheets of wet flesh sticking to your every feature. Having had a few moments to recover, you finally begin your resistance proper, however the crocodile's sheer strength keeps you pinned with ease. With two large hands forcing your arms against the cold stone wall, there is nothing you can do but wait and squirm pathetically as you are crammed down the esophagus. The seasoned predator guides you past his razor-sharp teeth with expert precision, apparently preferring his meals quite whole and intact. The sensation of being so utterly enveloped by a tube of flesh is an enthralling one, perhaps, were it not for the loud gulping noises, the rush of liquids and the thunder of a heartbeat near you. With your chest and waist utterly soaked in saliva, you know full well you have only a manner of seconds left in the outside world. Drawn ever further down into the digestive tract behind the dark green reptile's maw, you breach the entrance of the lewdly gurgling organ that would welcome you with a belch of acrid air."

				"A few weak kicks is all that is left of a certain {player.species}, before those limbs too disappear into the ravenous predator. The digestive cradle, meanwhile, squeezes your head as if planting a vile kiss, before the folds of flesh part again, leaving your head coated in slime and goop you would perhaps rather not identify. Once you are deposited fully into your temporary home, your organic prison shrinks further when your host burps loudly, forcing you into a tight ball of {player.fur}. He smacks his gut, holding and examining the large scaly bulge. \"Whew, little {player.species}, you fill me up quite nicely. Enjoy yourself in there, yeah?\" With that, the bouncer's task complete, he returns to his post near the door and lazily leans against the wall just as before. If not for the swollen, moving stomach, one might think nothing had changed. For now, though, Rech is content with gently rubbing his newly acquired prey."

				"With your work finished, you thank the crowd for their patronage, before you make your way back out of the makeshift arena. The small bedroom adjacent to the lobby invites you, offering a safe place to quietly sleep off your food. You muse for a second that it might be a bit of a design flaw to have to walk through the main room to get there, considering the need for secrecy, but you have a much more pressing need to sleep off your food than to think about such frivolities.",
				"Having completed the night's show, you decide to make your exit and head for the stairs leading back to the common room. Your huge gut sloshes and bounces with every step, but you manage to make it back up the poorly lit tunnel alright. You stumble into your allotted bedroom without too much trouble, but not without drawing stares from the one or two people who were hanging out here.",
				"Now that the match is complete, you let out a wet belch and saunter up the narrow staircase leading out of the underground area, all the while carefully managing your hefty, gurgling gut, so as not to bounce off of a wall. Before long, you end up in the small safe room without much further incident (not counting the more than a few stares)."

				"Luckily, Venna materializes from the poorly lit corridor leading out of the room. Wordlessly, she guides you back upstairs to the common room and into a small, inconspicuous room off to the side. She shows you inside, and to your surprise it's a small, cozy-looking bedroom with a carpet on the floor and a large bed at the fair end - no other furniture. The vixen gives you a knowing smile and gestures at your moving, swollen belly, then forward. \"Winner's privilege. You can sleep your prey off here safely. Door's locked from the inside, so no disturbances, you can leave when you feel you're... done.\" A toothy grin spreads on her muzzle as she slaps your gut, evoking a wet slosh and a loud gurgle from your digestive system. \"Nice first round, {player.name}, I'm impressed. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, and you can come get your share from me later.\" With that, she leaves you in silence, the oak door slamming shut behind her. Apparently she has a tendency to do that with doors."
